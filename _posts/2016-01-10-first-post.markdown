This is my first post to archive what I have learnt in the hope that it can help others. It's part of my New Year resolutions to share more about myself, my thoughts and opinions about the code I write or witness. I just graduated from the Singapore University of Technology and Design and also started work at Skyscanner as a Software Engineer. I hope that this marks the start of a continuous learning journey for myself!

A few things that I want to share in the blog for the next few months:

- blogging about some things that I have learnt in Ruby and Rails for the projects that I have worked on
- work on some machine learning, artificial intelligence problems
- improve my algorithm and data structure skills
- work on a side project that deals with scalability

And also, I hope to be:
- more active in my relationships with family and friends
- exercise and keep in shape
- cut down on distractions and focus on learning

I hope that this endeavor sustains :p
