I was invited to speak to the second batch of students at General Assembly to talk to them about my job experience at Skyscanner as a software engineer and the culture over there. I also gave them advice on the current outlook of jobs in the Singapore market, and how tips for interviewing for software engineer/developer roles in companies. 

Embedded below are my slides:
