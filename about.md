Hi! Welcome to my blog. I'm currently a software engineer at Skyscanner, building business intelligence software for customers to help them succeed in the marketplace. This blog is to document whatever I have learnt to solve the problems that I face in my work. I hope that whatever I post here can be helpful to the readers.

I am a graduate from the Singapore University of Technology and Design, and majored in Information Systems Technology and Design (ISTD) in Artificial Intelligence and Security and Comms. I now mostly write Python, Ruby and Javascript. I'm also interested in doing more Machine Learning, Neural Nets and Distributed Systems.
